title: School Days

I was born on a cold Wednesday in the city of Chennai sharply at 4:15 pm. I was brought up in a land of abundant sun named Vellore. It happens to be one of the hottest districts in my state. Seriously, the temperature in my hometown can go up to 41 degrees during summer. The sun rays can sting your skin to give a heroin shot of vitamin D. Sorry back on track, Concordance with the time of birth, the beautiful hours after school, I also liked to sweat in the playground. Instead of concentrating on a single sport, I learnt one sport every year. With collars lifted, I will say that I know at least five sports that I can play at an intermediate level. Family pressure, economic status, society, culture and traditions did not mould me to become a sportsperson but put a book in front of my face.
