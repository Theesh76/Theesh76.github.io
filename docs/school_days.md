title: School Days

I was born in the city of Chennai sharply at 4:15 pm on the day where the world celebrates its AIDS day. My entire childhood hails from a land of scorching sun named Vellore. It happens to be one of the hottest districts in my state. Seriously, the temperature in my hometown can go up to 41 degrees during summer. The sun rays can sting your skin to give a heroin shot of vitamin D. 

Concordance with the time of birth, the beautiful hours after school, I like to sweat in the playground. Instead of concentrating on a single sport, I learnt one sport every year. With collars lifted, I will say that I know at least five sports that I can play at an intermediate level. Family pressure, economic status, society, culture and traditions did not mould me to become a sportsperson but put a book in front of my face.

When I reminisce about my childhood days, the first thing that pops up in my head is those travel diaries to Chennai. My hometown lacked coaching institutes for the engineering entrance examinations. So, I travelled 6 hours every weekend from my hometown to Chennai and tiredly slouch in the classes. The worst part of commuting was the crowded, smelly trains. There were days you won't get a square foot area to stand and sitting in trains were always out of the options. Think of those hard days 

During the AIEEE exam day, my confidence levels were zero as I failed spectacularly in the IITJEE exams. But, something unusual happened during the 2011 AIEEE entrance examination. The set 1 question paper got leaked, each candidate was resorted to taking up the set2 question paper. The confidence in myself gleamed looking at the question paper as I knew the answers for more than half of the questions than set1 when checked later. Eventually, I cleared the entrance examination out of 1.1 million candidates appeared in that year. This incident marks the first connecting dot of my life that I truly cherish and makes me believe the quote "Everything happens for a reason".
