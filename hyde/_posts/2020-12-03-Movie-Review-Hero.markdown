It's a hackneyed Robin Hood movie filled with old action stunts, odourless comedy, and unnecessary romance. To start with the positives, the movie would have been an average hit, if it was released 15 years before. The credits section was informative, where they display the real "HEROS" and their inventions. Furthermore, I learned a new word "lobotomy". If we dig further and deeply for more positives, we would get disappointment and new swear words to describe the movie.
 
I get a thought that someone has deeply incepted Shivakarthikeyan brain and made him believe that he is a mass hero. I was not moved by Shivakarthikeyan's acting. He has these three standards expression that would recur in the film - a serious mock face, a love mock face and a sad mock face. There will be a police inspector, who shares the screen with the hero for a minute in the end. Even he proves his acting with his short presence. In my opinion, Shivakarthikeyan can pull off only comedy sequences. But, you would hardly find one in this movie. Its like finding a chicken piece in a kuska. 

Hero intro, Song, Heroine intro, Hero Loves Heroine, Song, Villain entry, Loved one dies, Hero becomes a superhero in one song, Hero kills Villian - Even Adam and Eve can deduce this plot. I can forgive all the aforementioned, I cannot forgive the fact that you guys sent a satellite through a helium balloon. So from the director's perspective, it is an action movie. However, it turned out to be laugh-riot movie.

**Overall - Beware. Stay away from this movie.**
