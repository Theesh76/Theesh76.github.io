A missed opportunity to witness this beautiful movie in the theaters. The movie should have been lifted above and celebrated. Sadly, its a silenced underdog movie. From dawn, the tamil cinema industry has been male dominated, especially direction. Watching romantic movies directed from males perspective has been narrow sided and too mainstream. The same old idea of "men doing anything for the female counterpart to win the love for her" has withered out like a leaf. However, Halitha Shameem (Director) gives a different dimension and a new perspective for love in this movie. 

The movie is divided into stories of four different people of four different age groups. The stories of these people show dichotomy between the male and female counterpart: Love between gold and garbage, between diseased and healthy, between married and unmarried, between age differenced married couple. The director breaks their barriers and unites them with love. Furthermore, the definition of love varies among these age groups. Love at childhood is innocent and unreasonable. At adolescence, it is physical and commitment. During middle ages, it is intimacy and understanding. At old ages, it is care, companionship and a hand to hold. The movies talks about complex issues in a subtle and a elegant manner. It doesn't overdose, thereby making it a feel good movie. 

**In my opinion, I feel that the movies directed by the female directors exhibit strong positivity and richness of life. One such movie is KD engira karuppudurai directed by Madhumita Sundararaman. These directors are lighting a new path for the Tamil cinema industry. Furthermore, they are chanting unsung ideas, which should have been echoed long before.**
