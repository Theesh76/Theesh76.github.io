A few years back, I recall my friend talking about water bombs from the second world war, which was lying dormant in the canals of the Netherlands. I was first sceptical hearing the fact that if those bombs still existed. But, knotting the true events from World War II to where the main protagonist lives bring novelty to the movie script. 

Even though the movie was categorized as a drama genre, it is a seat edge thriller to my personal opinion. At least to the audience sitting next to me, as they were shouting "Dei -bomb da bomb da", "aiyo police, odu da" for particular scenes. This impact created in the minds of the audience is a huge success to the director. Also, this would not be possible without the main protagonist - Attakathi Dinesh. I have seen almost all his movies and I would record it as his third-best, descending from Cuckoo and Visaranai. 
 
When we have positives loaded for the movie, there should be some baggage that the movie holds. It is nothing but the banal love story with caste problems amalgamated to the original script, which is unnecessary. It is quite understood, when we have PA. Ranjith producing the film. Hence, this movie can run without the main female lead Anandhi. However, Anandhi ties the audience with her acting and her beauty. She proves that she is well suited for the drama/romance genre starting from the movie - Kayal. Finally, we have Munishkhanth - a fool in his own world. His innocence and foolish acting induce humour in the film and worked out pretty good. The movie expose the reality of the lives of iron scrap workers and the politics encircling them. The director holds the reality until the very end, which should be plauded and it puts the movie's flaws in a silhouette.
 


**Overall - the brain likes novelty. Hence, the movie. Even though, the movie has its flaws. The story somehow intersects and creates adversity in the protagonist life, which in turn gives a gripping effect on the audience. In my opinion, it is a one-time watch and a worth 120 rupees movie ticket.**
