Sathish was born on a cold Wednesday sharply at 4:15 pm when all the school bells rang in Chennai, where all the children flocked out off school joyously. Concordance with the time of birth, he also liked the time after school hours to sweat in the playground. Instead of concentrating on a single sport, he learnt one sport every year. He is proud to say that he can play cricket, football, basketball, volleyball, shuttle, table tennis, handball and chess at an intermediate level. Family, economic status, peer pressure, traditions intertwined with his career, ambitions put a halt to his sports. But, one good thing about him is that he develops an interest in whatever he does. This good trait of his created a penchant for his studies and helped him to clear competitive exams to get into a prestigious institution to do his Bachelors.

Born in a big city, prospered in a small town named Vellore, Sathish got the chance to live his life alone and to do his bachelors in the city of Tiruchirapalli. During his bachelors, he is an ardent FIFA and a Handball player.
