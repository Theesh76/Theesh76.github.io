This proud guy holding a master degree from the Delft University of Technology is me. Re-winding back on how I got here?. I was born on a cold Wednesday in the city of Chennai sharply at 4:15 pm. Re-winded too much and cliched like a movie opening scene. Speaking about movies, I love watching movies and binging tv series. Not a professional movie critic but not a C-grade audience, Just an amateur blogger who loves to point out and write about films that touched his heart. Oops, Lost track with the about section. Coming back, I was born and grew up in a land of abundant vitamin D named Vellore. It happens to be one of the hottest districts in my state. Seriously, the temperature in my hometown can go up to 41 degrees during summer. The sun rays can sting your skin to give a heroin shot of vitamin D. Sorry back on track, Concordance with the time of birth, the beautiful hours after school, I also liked to sweat in the playground. Instead of concentrating on a single sport, I learnt one sport every year. With collars lifted, I will say that I know at least five sports that I can play at an intermediate level. Family pressure, economic status, society, culture and traditions did not mould me to become a sportsperson but put a book in front of my face. 

One good thing about me is that I can develop interests in whatever I do. This good trait of me created a penchant for my studies and helped me to clear competitive exams to get into a prestigious institution to do my Bachelors. My bachelor was in Instrumentation and Control, where I studied diverse technologies from electronics, coding, sensors, control systems and mathematics. In my initial Bachelor days, I spent mastering FIFA 14 rather than engineering. However, one area that drew my attention towards engineering was Robotics. Robotics competitions, class projects and summer internship created a penchant and pulled me back to love Engineering. Robotics created an interest for me because the Indian education system tested my memory skills rather than my practical skills from my childhood. So, it paved me a way to learn Engineering properly and learn the way I wanted. Apart from studies, I enjoyed playing Handball. We won many tournaments.
